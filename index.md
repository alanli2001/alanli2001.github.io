## About Me
I graduated from **Cornell University** with a bachelors in computer science. My personal interests include software development, game theory, statistics, and finance.

I have previously interned at **Google**, **Cutler Group**, and also the **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**.

## Work Experience
**Software Engineering Intern @ Google - Summer 2023:**
- I worked for the **Youtube Shorts** backend team, working on improving search suggestions and rankings related to shorts with **C++** and various API's (**Protobuf** messages).
- My main role was to help improve search suggestions for the Shorts Audio Picker, which is a content creation tool to make Shorts videos. I retrieved data from a user's Shorts Music Profile, which includes information about shorts the user has watched, and fed it into a search suggestion model used by the Shorts Audio Picker.
- Additionally, I added search indexing for a music classifier for use as a retrieval and ranking signal across various search applications in YouTube and modified a ranking model to work on YouTube Shorts as well, allowing new, trendy songs to appear higher in YouTube Shorts search results.

**Quantitative Trading Intern @ Cutler Group - Summer 2022:**
- Cutler Group is a options market maker that trades around 1% of the U.S. equity option volume.
- I analyzed extremely hard to borrow stocks to see if Merrill Lynch's loan rate is predictive of the terminal stock price through time with **pandas**, **NumPy**, **statsmodels**, and **MySQL**.
- I also helped increase profitabillity by analyzing trades across various factors and developed insights into edge retention and trade quality.
- Attended daily classes consisting of options theory education and mock trading.

**Software Engineering Intern @ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) - Summer 2021:**
- I developed software for the Alfresco Content Services team, which helps store and manage over 30 billion financial documents for FINRA analysts to use while regulating the market.
- I rewrote automation tests with **Typescript**, **Selenium**, and **Cucumber**, which allowed my team to migrate to an updated version of the Alfresco Application Development Framework.
- I also wrote new **JUnit** tests in **Java** for their backend, increasing test coverage by more than **10%**.
