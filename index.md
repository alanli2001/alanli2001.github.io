## About Me
I am currently a BS/MEng student at **Cornell University**, graduating in May 2023. My personal interests include game theory, machine learning, and market making.

I'm currently an incoming quantitative trading intern at **Cutler Group, LP**, and I previously interned at **FINRA** on the Alfresco Content Services Team.

## Places I've worked
**Cutler Group, LP (Incoming Quantitative Trading Intern)**
- I'll be joining Cutler Group in July 2022, working in San Francisco and learning about options market making.

**FIRNA (Software Engineering Intern):**
- I developed software for the Alfresco Content Services team, which helps store and manage over 30 billion financial documents for FINRA analysts to use while regulating the market.
- My main role was to rewrite automation tests with Typescript, Selenium, and Cucumber. 
- In doing so, it allowed my team to migrate to a newer version of the Alfresco Application Development Framework.
- I also wrote new JUnit tests in Java for their backend, increasing test coverage by more than 10\%.

**Cornell:**
- I am a student athlete competing for the Men's Swim and Dive team. I usually spend around 25 hours per week to training and competing as a Division I student athlete and am a Cornell Athletics Letter Winner, awarded to top performing student athletes.
- I am also a part of the Big Red Leadership Institute, a biweekly workshop that focus on improving leadership skills for student athletes.
- I also enjoy playing weekly cash and tournament games with other members of the Poker Association of Cornell.

## Projects I've worked on
**Covid-19 Hospitalization Prediction:**
- I developed and trained a neural network regression model to predict number of hospitalizations due to Covid-19 in European countries using PyTorch.
- This achieved over 85\% accuracy in predicting an increase or decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases in European countries by implementing a soft-margin SVM classifier with sklearn.

**Battlecode:**
- I competed in MIT's 2020 Battlecode competition, which features a turn-based strategy game where robots need to demonstrate a mastery of both resource management and combat tactics.
- Placed 27th in U.S. tournament, and 45th in scrim rankings out of 550+ teams

**March Madness Prediction Model:**
- I constructed a logistic regression model to predict match results in the 2019 March Madness tournament.
- Placed in the top 10% in the 2019 Men's Google Cloud and NCAA Kaggle competition with 0.46 log loss.
