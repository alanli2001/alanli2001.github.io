## About Me
I am currently a BS/MCS student at the **University of Illinois**, graduating in May 2022. My personal interests include cryptography, distributed systems and networking, and decentralized finance.

I'm currently an incoming software developer at **DRW**, and I previously interned at **Akuna Capital**. Both companies are proprietary trading firms working on designing strategies for derivatives trading. Prior to this, I interned at **Cloudflare** on the Magic Transit team.

## Places I've worked
**DRW (Incoming SWE)**
- I'll be joining DRW in July 2022, working in Chicago on the Fixed Income, Commodities, and Currencies Options desk.

**Akuna Capital (Intern):**
- I built an optimization engine for process-thread allocations on an internal runtime.
- This was used to improve process layouts on multithreaded target machines for the company's trading engine application.
- As a net result, the project reduced latency and increased throughput compared to developer-tuned resource allocations.
- Automating the process of manually tuning allocations saved the company time and allowed for a tighter performance-based feedback loop.

**Cloudflare (Intern):**
- I redesigned a portion of the private network interconnect product, allowing additional functionality for users.
  - This specifically included enabling private IP routing using Cloudflare's edge servers as a WAN, a product now available as [Magic WAN](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/). 
  - While Magic WAN supports a variety of packet on-ramps, the company's PNI product serves the largest enterprise users. 
- I additionally created a customer-facing network diagnostic tool with a team of interns ([Netvisor](https://api.cloudflare.com/#diagnostics-traceroute)). 
  - The tool gathers information like latency and packet routes from Cloudflare's 200 data centers, and gives customers visibility into networking issues.
  - It is currently in use internally and externally to trace packet routes across the internet and identify outages. 

**University of Illinois:**
- I am a teaching assistant for **CS 233 - Computer Architecture** during the Spring 2022 semester. I hold office hours, support students in lab sections, and develop and grade assignments and exams.
- I was also a teaching assistant for **CS 421 - Programming Languages and Compilers** during the Fall 2021 semester. I held office hours, taught students course material, and developed and graded assignments and exams.
- I also worked as course staff for **CS 374 - Intro to Algorithms and Models of Computation** during the Fall 2020 semester. I graded assignments and helped students in office hours.

## Projects I've worked on
**better-hand:**
- I built a No-Limit Hold 'Em equity calculator, written in Rust. The tool displays your equity against a range of starting hands that an opponent may have, allowing you to play poker in a more optimal way. (**[Better Hand](https://crates.io/crates/better-hand)**)

**LedgerStockUpdate:**
- I designed a command-line stock ticker tool written in Go, which formats data for the Ledger accounting suite (**[Ledger Stock Update](https://github.com/adchari/LedgerStockUpdate)**).

## Interests
- Using Emacs for everything ([M-x butterfly](https://xkcd.com/378/)).
- Learning more about:
  - performance optimization, 
  - networking,
  - improving the modern state of finance using technology,
  - practical uses of machine learning models in finance,
  - scientific computing/methods to approximate and optimize functions,
  - algorithms and CS theory.
- Exploring unique programming languages and comparing them. My personal favorites include:
  - Rust and Go to replace C and C++,
  - Julia to replace Python for scientific computing and ML,
  - Haskell and OCaml, because FP is cool and typed > untyped.

## Other
- Some of my favorite courses at UIUC include:
  - ECE 598 - Principles of Blockchains
  - CS 598 - Quantum Cryptography
  - CS 580 - Algorithmic Game Theory
  - CS 407 - Applied Cryptography
  - CS 473 - Algorithms
- Some of my favorite books are:
  - Flash Boys - Michael Lewis
  - Trading at the Speed of Light - Donald Angus MacKenzie
