## About Me
I am currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at **Cornell University**, graduating in May 2023. My personal interests include game theory, machine learning, and quantitative trading.

I will be interning at **Datadog** as a software engineering intern this spring semester, and will be headed to **IMC Trading** in the fall as a quantitative trader.

I have previously interned at **Cutler Group** as a quantitative trading intern, and also **FINRA**  as a software engineering intern.

## Work Experience
**Quantitative Trading Intern @ Cutler Group - Summer 2022:**
- I analyzed extremely hard to borrow stocks to see if Merrill Lynch's loan rate is predictive of the terminal stock price through time with pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, and MySQL.
- I also helped increase profitabillity by analyzed trades and developing insights into edge retention and trade quality.

- I developed software for the Alfresco Content Services team, which helps store and manage over 30 billion financial documents for FINRA analysts to use while regulating the market.

## Projects

- I competed in MIT's 2020 Battlecode competition, which features a turn-based strategy game where robots need to demonstrate a mastery of both resource management and combat tactics.

## Extracurriculars
