This page is launched using GitHub Pages, a static site generator that enables your Markdown files to be converted into HTML pages on the website. This system is generated using Jekyll, a static-site generation tool that integrates tightly with GitHub Pages. The current workflow is simply pushing to the repository, which updates the live environment. Check it out for yourself!
